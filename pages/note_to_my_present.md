## Note to my Present
## Dear Sholanki,
I feel  you. I get you. You are lonely. You feel miserable and you feel shit because nothing is going your way. Here's a gob-smacking truth: it is not meant to go your way. You
are supposed to make your own way. So, quit feeling sorry for yourself, get your ass in line and start doing. Things will fall in place. Quit whining. You are not able to move -
big deal; you are not punching, kicking and rolling around, you are crying for company, you want to go to base and meet your favorite person and it is not happening - BIG DEAL!
GET OVER IT LITERALLY! Suck it up. Bad things happen and it happened. Bad things pass and it will pass. So, get your lady pants on and start doing - visualizing, creating but do
something. Stop sitting on your ass all the time, no one can move your ass except you; so start moving; seriously full throttle on - MOVE literally.
I will not be there to say it over and over again, but hardships come and go - you can choose to cry or choose to learn. The choice is always yours. So, choose and choose wisely.
Have a good day, literally
### Love
#### Sholanki (The Logical one)
