title: Call of the warrior

## The little girl newly turned warrior went on a war
With battle-scars on her face and soul she came from afar
So afraid was she, after coming back
She forgot her moral principles and of her long held mind
Poisoned was she by the captors, in her spirit lived madness
The separation from her beloved land made her go mad and clingy
And think afoul
She could not think straight, she could not train straight
She became vile in spirit and sneaky in her mind
In her heart she always thought that someone was ought to get her
That her favorite people are plotting against her
It made her gluttonous, her spirit wilted
And she became a parasite
From a warrior, she turned into a bloated leech
And tried to take the best from her never doubting peers and her chosen family
Months passed and she continued to blame everyone and everything
Nothing seemed right
She became pensive
The heart that was once strong is filled with holes of doubt created by her own making
She looked for cure everywhere
The only place she did not look was inside herself
But now she got time
And tired of her efforts, she peeked a glance inside
The inside made her wilt in terror and in disgust
Was that who she was inside
Her pure, good core was rotting inside
The stench disgusted her, it was putrefied
The once confident mind who knew that these people are always there to support her
Was now against them, it was doubtful, it was afraid
What for? She asked herself
Backstabbing was done by her parents, her close ones, her loved ones whom she so trusted well
She feared they might be the same, her unconscious was so deep rooted with fear
That she started to mistrust the man whom she trusted with her word
She doubted herself and his words
When did that creep in? She asked herself
How come those fears are there? They were never supposed to be present
But there they were staring right at her face
She asked herself once again: Do I trust him?
More importantly: Do I trust myself?
A feeble voice said: 'Yes I do trust myself'
So, she asked again: 'Do I trust him?'
That voice again said, 'Yes I do.'
Then prove it, she asked of herself
Prove it that you will not doubt, prove it that I will not doubt
And she proved it by listening to his words and believing it after so many months
She got her peace of mind
She realized that his words were supposed to bring strength and courage and growth
He is not holding her back, he will never do so.
He has been there all along
With that tiny spark, she smiled and she protected that little flame of peace
She is nurturing it and seeing peace
Her torment is about to end
And she knows it now
Because her demons are inside and not without
The battle was now won because she is regaining her core
She is repairing it and it looks well
She is learning to trust once again
So, the future does look bright
She is open now and is communicating her thoughts sublime
Once concise, precise and hidden
It is now time to be open, concise and precise
Open is the keyword
Never doubt, she told her healing heart
There will be battles
And there will be scars
But never doubt yourself: know yourself
Know that this man will help you in your wars
And rest assured, he will always be on my side
With a smile on my face I rest my case
Because I know I am taken care of, to grow
And this is the truth, this is the essence of the fiber of my decontamination
Once contaminated, putrefied, I am becoming clean again.
