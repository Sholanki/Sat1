title: Call of the warrior

The little girl newly turned warrior went on a war,<br>
With battle-scars on her face and soul she came from afar<br>
So afraid was she, after coming back<br>
She forgot her moral principles and of her long held mind<br>
Poisoned was she by the captors, in her spirit lived madness<br>
The separation from her beloved land made her go mad and clingy<br>
And think afoul<br>
She could not think straight, she could not train straight<br>
She became vile in spirit and sneaky in her mind<br>
In her heart she always thought that someone was ought to get her<br>
That her favorite people are plotting against her<br>
It made her gluttonous, her spirit wilted<br>
And she became a parasite<br>
From a warrior, she turned into a bloated leech<br>
And tried to take the best from her never doubting peers and her chosen family<br>
Months passed and she continued to blame everyone and everything<br>
Nothing seemed right<br>
She became pensive<br>
The heart that was once strong is filled with holes of doubt created by her own making<br>
She looked for cure everywhere<br>
The only place she did not look was inside herself<br>
But now she got time<br>
And tired of her efforts, she peeked a glance inside<br>
The inside made her wilt in terror and in disgust<br>
Was that who she was inside<br>
Her pure, good core was rotting inside<br>
The stench disgusted her, it was putrefied<br>
The once confident mind who knew that these people are always there to support her<br>
Was now against them, it was doubtful, it was afraid<br>
What for? She asked herself<br>
Backstabbing was done by her parents, her close ones, her loved ones whom she so trusted well<br>
She feared they might be the same, her unconscious was so deep rooted with fear<br>
That she started to mistrust the man whom she trusted with her word<br>
She doubted herself and his words<br>
When did that creep in? She asked herself<br>
How come those fears are there? They were never supposed to be present<br>
But there they were staring right at her face<br>
She asked herself once again: Do I trust him?<br>
More importantly: Do I trust myself?<br>
A feeble voice said: 'Yes I do trust myself'<br>
So, she asked again: 'Do I trust him?'<br>
That voice again said, 'Yes I do.'<br>
Then prove it, she asked of herself<br>
Prove it that you will not doubt, prove it that I will not doubt<br>
And she proved it by listening to his words and believing it after so many months<br>
She got her peace of mind<br>
She realized that his words were supposed to bring strength and courage and growth<br>
He is not holding her back, he will never do so.<br>
He has been there all along<br>
With that tiny spark, she smiled and she protected that little flame of peace<br>
She is nurturing it and seeing peace<br>
Her torment is about to end<br>
And she knows it now<br>
Because her demons are inside and not without<br>
The battle was now won because she is regaining her core<br>
She is repairing it and it looks well<br>
She is learning to trust once again<br>
So, the future does look bright<br>
She is open now and is communicating her thoughts sublime<br>
Once concise, precise and hidden<br>
It is now time to be open, concise and precise<br>
Open is the keyword<br>
Never doubt, she told her healing heart<br>
There will be battles<br>
And there will be scars<br>
But never doubt yourself: know yourself<br>
Know that this man will help you in your wars<br>
And rest assured, he will always be on my side<br>
With a smile on my face I rest my case<br>
Because I know I am taken care of, to grow<br>
And this is the truth, this is the essence of the fiber of my decontamination<br>
Once contaminated, putrefied, I am becoming clean again.<br>
