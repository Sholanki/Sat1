## Hi, today is a despondent day. I feel good and yet lonely. It is cumbersome to lie down and concentrate on move than actually moving. It is not a fun way to be. I love kicking, punching, rolling in other words simply moving and now I have to lie down and visualize it. It is terrifying to do it and imagine myself doing it. Imagination is the only solace that I have at present.
## Sometimes, the bouts are repetitive: same person, same movement but I move differently but will that be the exact response in reality? I miss interacting for real. The reality, the aliveness of having a punch delivered; the adrenaline rush that surges when I evade it and the triumph when I hit back after a calculated move. It is over in one minute but what a triumph it is to feel it coursing through my veins; the sheer learning of reality that life provides in its primal glory.
## Then it makes me think; is it not what I am going through life? What am I cribbing about? Life itself has provided me with this handicap - to sustain it, to live through it and maybe learn; learn how to move while still strapped to the ground; tempted to move and explore and yet not do it and use my imagination to do so. It is a learning too..but for how long, time does not tell; nor do I know, maybe after 40 years or so, I will consider this phase as a bleep in my whole lifetime but right now I am passing through it and it seems torment.
## I want it to stop, I want the period to be over but I do not decide. The faithful will seek God for help. The strong will turn to themselves. I do not know who to turn to: maybe my disembodied self who is confused and little bit in anguish and who wants to come out of this bloody mess and find glory in the rings again.
## One day down, and I am sitting here thinking to move on. Killing time is not an option; getting my angst out is a good way to start; imagination a good form of solace: maybe I will grow, maybe not. Who knows! Maybe like Sherlock, I am addicted to movement, the best kind of movement, the art of movement and I need my fix and I am not getting it so I am running in haywire fashion waiting for it. What do I know? Maybe the next day, it will all be over.
## That brings me to hope. Hope for a better tomorrow. Hope for a better today. Hope does not work for me. Work works, effort works and action definitely works. Hopelessness makes me move forward, makes me stop believing in better day and start believing in my own messy, confused self; no matter how bleak - that's all I have, I can count upon; even in the darkest of times; I will be present with myself - I do not know about anyone else.
## I have always heard tears are for the weak but I think they are messengers saying that I am fed up of this shit and literally want to move. And if the shit grows, I really do not know what to do except maybe rebel but rebel against who and for what? Who the hell will provide and what will be provided? I do not know. All I know is that I am tired of resting. Patience is not for me. I am impatient who loves quick results and I am done waiting.........
## Tomorrow it is 15th; supposed to be Independence Day. I vouch to get my freedom tomorrow because I had enough.
